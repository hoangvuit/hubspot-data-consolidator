Hubspot Data Consolidator helps pulling data from Hubspot to store on our own managed database. So that we can develop a view to query any information that we want.

This repo is just the React components (due to confidential stuffs).

So, in the view of a Rails project, just use this:

<%= react_component("HSTool", prerender: false) %>
